## Collections UI

An interface that sources ElasticSearch indices and provides IIIF manifests.

Also, in conjunction with [IIIF Dynamo](https://github.com/ub-leipzig/iiif-dynamo),
the UI provides access to dynamic keyword sourced manifest assembly.

See `orp.js` for an example.

See [manifest-metadata-processor](https://github.com/ub-leipzig/manifest-metadata-processor) for
the tooling to create JSON documents for elastic search from manifest metadata.
